Hello! Welcome to my intense action Frogger game!

Objective and Game Play:
Try and score as many points as possible! Move the player character across the board 
and reach the water before the bugs intercept your path. You only get 3 lives so make
your attempts count. A life is taken away if a bug gets you. Once you reach the water, 
you start again back at the starting pad. 

The higher up your score gets, the harder the game becomes so keep trying to improve
your score! 

The game board consists of a starting pad, 2 grassy paths (which are safe zones)
and 3 stone paths that lead to the water. This is where the bugs can get you. 

Keep an eye out for gems!  They are worth additional points but they disappear
if you don't collect them in time. 

When all 3 lives are used the game is over. Select the reset button at the top left of the screen 
to play again or just refresh the page.  

Finally, change your character by selecting a character image at the bottom with your mouse.

Enjoy the game and have fun!

Scoring:
100 points: Move across the board and reach the water without getting hit by a bug!
100 points: Collect a blue gem
500 points: Collect a green gem
1000 points: Collect an orange gem (they are rare and disappear fast so watch carefully)

Character Movement:
Use the keypad on the keyboard to move the character. The player initially starts on the starting pad.
UP ARROW - Moves player one space up. Player can not move past the water.
RIGHT ARROW - Moves a player one space to the right. Player can not move off board.
DOWN ARROW - Moves player one space down. Player can not move past the starting pad.
LEFT ARROW - Moves a player one space to the left. Player can not move off board.

Character Selection:
At any point in the game the player can select a different character. Move your mouse to the bottom
of the screen and click on the character the player wants and it will switch!
